# Agent Directory

A complete AI-powered software development organization. This repo defines a team of specialized agents that takes product ideas from ideation through to working software — covering discovery, design, architecture, and build.

## How It Works

This repo is used as a **Git submodule** inside each project repository. The agent definitions, skills, templates, and commands live here and stay up to date. Project-specific content (brief, decisions, discovery docs, design docs, code) lives in the project repo.

```
your-project-repo/
  .agency/              ← this repo, as a submodule
  .claude/
    commands/           ← symlinked to .agency/.claude/commands/
  project-brief.md
  decisions.md
  discovery/
  design/
  build/
  src/
  CLAUDE.md
```

  Working Software

[/retrospective] ── Review all phases. Propose and apply specific
                    improvements back to agent_directory. Agency
                    gets smarter with every project.
```

### Checkpoint Philosophy

Checkpoints are placed at **irreversible decision points** — where going forward locks you into something expensive to undo.

| Checkpoint | Gate | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| **CP1 — Problem-Solution Fit** | Discovery → Design & Architecture | Cheapest point to pivot |
| **CP2 — Build Approval** | Design & Architecture → Build | Most critical. Changes after this are expensive. |
| **CP3 — Milestone Review** | Per milestone during Build | Optional. Enable per project. |

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Guided** | You approve each checkpoint before the next phase begins |
| **Autonomous** | Agents run end-to-end. Checkpoints are logged but not blocking. |

In either mode, agents **always escalate** genuine blockers — a fork in the road where neither path is clearly better, or where a decision requires your values or priorities.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/resume` | Reload project context at the start of any new session — always run this first |
| `/new-project` | Initialize a new project — collects brief, sets mode, creates tracking files |
| `/discovery` | Run the Discovery Team |
| `/architecture` | Run the Design & Architecture Team (requires CP1 approval) |
| `/build` | Run the Build Team (requires CP2 approval) |
| `/checkpoint` | Review and action a checkpoint |
| `/sprint` | Plan and run a single sprint, or resume a sprint in progress |
| `/refine` | Run backlog refinement for the next sprint (PM + UX Designer) |
| `/scope-change` | Handle a proposed scope change — assesses tier and manages re-work path |
| `/release` | Run the release checklist and deploy to production |
| `/retrospective` | Review the project and apply learnings back to the agency framework |
| `/status` | Show current project phase and checkpoint statuses |

## Setting Up a New Project

### Prerequisites
- This repo (`agent_directory`) accessible on GitHub
- A new GitHub repo created for your project

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone your new project repo
git clone https://github.com/[you]/[project-name]
cd [project-name]

# 2. Add agent_directory as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/[you]/agent_directory .agency

# 3. Run the setup script to symlink commands
bash .agency/setup.sh

# 4. Copy the project CLAUDE.md template
cp .agency/templates/project-CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md

# 5. Commit the setup
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize agency framework"

# 6. Open Claude Code and run /new-project
```

### What You Get After Setup

```
[project-repo]/
  .agency/              ← agent_directory submodule (pinned to a commit)
  .claude/
    commands/           ← symlinked to .agency/.claude/commands/
  CLAUDE.md             ← copied from .agency/templates/project-CLAUDE.md, fill in
  .gitmodules           ← created by git submodule add
```

After running `/new-project`:
```
  project-brief.md      ← source of truth for all agents
  decisions.md          ← append-only decision log
```

After `/discovery`:
```
  discovery/
    checkpoint-1.md
    market-analysis.md
    personas/
      [persona-name].md     ← one file per persona
    user-journey.md
    assumption-map.md
```

After `/architecture`:
```
  design/
    checkpoint-2.md
    architecture.md
    tradeoff-log.md
    risk-register.md
    prd.md
    technical-research-report.md
    ux-flows.md               ← IA, key flows, screen inventory (not all detailed screens)
    epics/
      EP-001-[slug].md        ← one per epic, approved at CP2
    stories/                  ← empty at CP2; populated during backlog refinement
```

After `/build` (grows sprint by sprint):
```
  build/
    code-standards.md
    implementation-plan.md    ← milestones → sprints → tasks, with reviews
    infrastructure-plan.md
    analytics-plan.md
    test-strategy.md
    test-cases/
      [feature].md
    qa-reports/
      [sprint-or-task].md
    checkpoint-3-M1.md        ← one per milestone (M1, M2, ...) if CP3 enabled
    checkpoint-3-M2.md
    release-[version].md      ← after /release
  design/
    stories/
      US-001-[slug].md        ← elaborated during backlog refinement, one sprint ahead
    sprint-flows/
      sprint-1.1.md           ← detailed screen specs per sprint (just-in-time)
  changes/                    ← scope change requests (created by /scope-change)
  src/
    ...
```

## Updating the Agency Framework

Each project pins to a specific commit of this repo — updates are deliberate, not automatic. To pull the latest agent definitions, skills, and commands into a project:

```bash
cd .agency
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add .agency
git commit -m "Update agency framework to latest"
```

---

## Improving the Agency

If you develop a better agent definition, skill, or command while working on a project, contribute it back:

```bash
cd .agency
# make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improve [agent/skill/command]: [what changed and why]"
git push origin main
cd ..
git add .agency
git commit -m "Update agency to include [improvement]"
```

---

## Principles

Foundational beliefs that shape how all agents think and work — always in effect, not applied situationally.

| Principle | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| `principles/spec-driven-development.md` | Spec is written first and is always the source of truth. Code never drives spec changes. The spec hierarchy: Problem Statement → PRD (epics) → Architecture → Story (just-in-time) → Task → Code. |
| `principles/agile.md` | Requirements are elaborated iteratively — structural architecture and epics at CP2, detailed stories just-in-time one sprint ahead via backlog refinement. Build runs in sprints within milestones. Backlog refinement, sprint planning, and sprint review are the core ceremonies. |

## Shared Skills

Cross-cutting methodologies used by multiple agents.

| Skill | Used By | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| `skills/assumption-mapping.md` | Product Strategist, Systems Architect | Before finalizing any direction or architecture |
| `skills/options-framing.md` | Orchestrator, Systems Architect, Engineering Lead | When escalating a fork-in-the-road decision |
| `skills/scope-pressure-test.md` | Product Manager, Engineering Lead | To validate MVP scope and implementation plan |
| `skills/security-review.md` | QA Engineer, Engineering Lead | Any task touching auth, data handling, or external input |
